What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository causes git to create the .git directory and populate it with whatever information goes into
a fresh repository. You need to do this so git has that metadata.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area differs from the other two things because you can easily modify it without changing the other two.
This is valuable because you might change your mind about what you want to add to a commit, and you can do that
non-destructively with the staging area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By running git diff --staged before committing.
